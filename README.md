# The Juma Project

# This is a MERN stack project to create a Speaker Request Platform bridging the gap between speakers and organizations allowing speakers to share their open calendar with their community provisioning quick speaker requests, dashboard views of upcoming and past events, and an easy way for both speakers and organizations to search, request, and confirm available dates.
